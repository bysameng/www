				<p>Hi, I'm Sam. I like to make games. Most everything here is made from scratch, including this website. Credit must be given to the incredible typefaces "Lekton" and "Silkscreen," and various sounds from <a href="http://www.freesound.org">freesound.org</a>. If any Linux versions are wanted, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and I'll compile one for you. </p>
				<p>There are some broken links, but they'll be fixed eventually.</p>
				<br>
				
				<br>
				<p>Also, this website is hosted on a netbook at home, so please be nice on my internet.</p>
